# MQTT-RabbitMQ-MongoDB Integration

This project demonstrates a simple integration between MQTT, RabbitMQ, and MongoDB using Python. It consists of a message producer, a message consumer, and a Flask API to query data from MongoDB.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Producer**: Publishes MQTT messages to RabbitMQ every second with a "status" field containing a random value between 0 and 6.
2. **Consumer**: Consumes MQTT messages from RabbitMQ, processes them, and stores them in MongoDB.
3. **Flask API**: Provides an endpoint to query the count of each status within a specified time range.

## Components

1. **Producer**: `producer.py`
2. **Consumer**: `consumer.py`
3. **Flask API**: `api.py`

## Installation
